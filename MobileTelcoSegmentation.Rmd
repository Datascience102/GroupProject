#Context of the project
We are using a database with mobile telecommunication consumption data.

The data belongs to a mobile telecom company that operates in Ghana, and our focus will be exclusively on customers who buy prepaid packages (similar to Starhub prepaid packages)

The company uses an old customer segmentation to design service packages (voice, roaming, data, etc) and to target sales initiatives. However, there is the perception that the segmentation is outdated and not working anymore as it should.
<br>

#1)	The business questions:
The objective is to create a new segmentation based on data of customer usage of the different services, so the company can better offer and design the right packages to the right customer segments.

1) What are the main customer segments based on historical usage of the different services (voice, data, etc)? 

2) And how shall we serve them better with our services?


#2)	The process
List and description of steps below)



#3)	The data
##a.	Load the data



##b.	Describe the data 
(highlevel description of contents, # of rows, # of columns, list the columns and its meaning, show a sample of the data)



#4)	PART 1: Factor/Component selection

##Step 1: Descriptive statistics of the data



##Step 2: Visualize the data
Some visual charts of the data that are useful to understand the data (e.g. histogram of gigabytes used per client)




##Step 3: Check correlations
(this is another step to just get to know better the data)



##Step 4: Choose method to select number of factors/components

i.	This part will imply going through several iterations of playing with the methods and discussing the results until it all makes sense




##Step 5: Name and describe the final selected factors/components




##Step 6: Consolidate all the data into only the factors/components




#5)	PART 2: Segmentation

##Step 1: Decide on pair-wise distance metric
Visualize the pair-wise distances and decide distance metric to define how different customers must be to be considered different




##Step 2: Segmentation and Robustness Analysis

###i.	Segmentation/Robustness Analysis
Play around with the different segmentation methods until we get a result that makes sense
<br>
Show the different method used, its results and why it didnâ€™t make sense






#c.	Step 3: Profile and interpret the above defined segments
This is the final output
