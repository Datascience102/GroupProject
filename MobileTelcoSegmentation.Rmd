####a.	Load the data



####b.	Describe the data (highlevel description of contents, # of rows, # of columns, list the columns and its meaning, show a sample of the data)



###4)	PART 1: Factor/Component selection

####a.	Step 1: Descriptive statistics of the data



####b.	Step 2: Some visual charts of the data that are useful to understand the data (e.g. histogram of gigabytes used per client)




####c.	Step 3: Check correlations (this is another step to just get to know better the data)



####d.	Step 4: Choose method to select number of factors/components

#####i.	This part will imply going through several iterations of playing with the methods and discussing the results until it all makes sense




####e.	Step 5: Name and describe the final selected factors/components




####f.	Step 6: Consolidate all the data into only the factors/components




###5)	PART 2: Segmentation

####a.	Step 1: Visualize the pair-wise distances and decide distance metric to define how different customers must be to be considered different

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#####ii.	Robustness Analysis - Show the different method used, its results and why it didnâ€™t make sense






####c.	Step 3: Profile and interpret the above defines segments
#####i.	This is the final output
